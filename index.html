        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Srikar, and I am a 9th-grade student at Sri Gayatri School. I was born on October 18, 2010, in the serene village of Chalivindri. Growing up in a close-knit family has shaped who I am today; my dad, Gopalakrishna, and my mom, Saraswathi, have always supported my dreams. I also have a wonderful sister named Reshma, who inspires me with her creativity and determination.

            My Passion for Web Development
            From a young age, I found myself fascinated by technology and how it can transform ideas into reality. My journey into the world of coding began when I discovered my love for web development. I enjoy the process of building websites and creating user-friendly interfaces. There’s something incredibly rewarding about seeing my code come to life on the screen!
            
            To enhance my skills, I am currently learning Python through CCBP Nextwave. This program has opened up new avenues for me, teaching me not just coding, but also problem-solving skills and the importance of collaboration in technology projects. I am excited about the endless possibilities that come with mastering programming languages and web technologies.
            
            Hobbies and Interests
            Outside of coding, I have a variety of interests that keep me engaged:
            
            Reading: I enjoy diving into books, especially those related to technology and fiction. They expand my imagination and knowledge.
            Gaming: Video games are not just a hobby for me; they spark my interest in game development and the coding behind them.
            Sports: I believe in maintaining a balance, so I love playing sports like cricket and badminton, which help me stay active and focused.
            Future Aspirations
            As I look to the future, my goal is to become a proficient web developer and eventually work on projects that make a positive impact on society. I dream of creating websites and applications that solve real-world problems and enhance user experiences. I am excited to continue learning and growing in this field!
            
            Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I am eager to share my projects, experiences, and the skills I develop along the way. Feel free to connect with me if you share similar interests or have any questions!</p>
